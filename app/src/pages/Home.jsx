              <p>
                Hello! Allow me to introduce myself, I'm a software engineering student at
                Polytechnique Montreal.
              </p>

              <p>
                I have acquired valuable professional experience in both the gaming industry and
                cybersecurity. These roles have significantly contributed to my skill set, providing
                me with comprehensive knowledge and expertise in these dynamic fields.
              </p>

              <p>
                I genuinely love diving into new tech stuff and teaming up with people. I'm always
                up for getting my hands dirty in fresh projects. To me, software is all about being
                creative, solving real problems, and working together. Can't wait to see what's
                next!
